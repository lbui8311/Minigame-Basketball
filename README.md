## What & How it works!
- A text-based basketball minigame called “Eleventh”, written in C and Assembly languages.
- The game will prompt two players to battle each other by picking the “Point(s)”, the max is 3 points per turn.
- After each player has chosen the point(s), the scoring algorithm will then calculate whether or not that point(s) will be counted toward the player’s total score, based on the scoring likeliness.
- At the end, the player that has the highest score wins, the game is up to 11 points.
